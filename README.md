This is Source Code Management Project

Welcome to all my collaborators. You all are free to send me a pull request who feels can contribute to my project source code.

About Project

Police Station Management System is based on the concept of managing criminal records. Before stepping into the main menu a user has to pass through a login system to get access, then the user can manage criminal records by adding, updating, removing, viewing and searching for details. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.
Talking about the features of the Police Station management system, the user can add various information about the criminals. For that, the user has to provide convict’s id, name, age, gender, height, weight, crime, face details, conviction, etc. Apart from this, the user can view/check a list of the records, search, modify and remove records too. The user just has to provide convict id in order to search for a criminal’s record.
The system creates an external file to store the user’s data permanently. This program mainly focuses on CRUD with the searching function. Police Station Management system is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it.

As the Manager, I will be contributing in code by 
1)defining the functions,
2) creating the structure of date of arrest, 
3)  creating a structure for details of the crime of criminal
4) creating a structure for the physical description of the criminal
5) creating a structure for details of F.I.R,

Branching Strategy:-

Every collaborator will create his own branch and work into that branch only and will push the file by their Branch. After All the three branches are pushed, the collaborators will send me a pull request and I will review their code and will merge it with my master if  it is bug free.
Now, all the Branches namely :-
devmalya1, aman and Devansh_Test2
are pushed respectively from their branches and now the collaborators will send me pull request and I will review it and then accept and merge the branches into the master.


According to the pull request, my collaborators include with their functions in code:-
1)	Devmalya Bandyopadhyay:-  created the class for criminal, function to check that input is non numeric , function to check sex has only one character,
2)	 Aman Kumar Gupta:- function for showing convicts record, function for deleting a record, function to check correct format of date ,
3)	 Devansh Markan :-function to modify record 
   
                                                          MERGING 

1.	I have accepted the pull request from Devmalya Bandhopadya and I have merged it from the Master Branch as the code was very well written with proper intendation as well.
2.	I have accepted the pull request from Aman Gupta and I have merged his branch (aman) from the master branch as his code helped me in making my program even more updated and gave it a better shape.
3.	Now, the final and last merge is complete. I have accepted the pull request from Devansh markan to merge his branch and all the 3 branches are now merged into the master.

                                                       END OF THE PROJECT

I thank all the three contributors of the project for their constant support and I really like the concept and techniques that they have used in their code. 
       
                                                           Thank You
